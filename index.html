            <h2>What is HTML ?</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title&gt; tag can be written as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>

            <h2>Getting started with HTML</h2>
            <p>In this article, we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!</p>
            <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
            <img src="img/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="structure of HTML element">
            <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">The opening tag:</span> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">The content:</span> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">The closing tag:</span> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
            <h3>Void elements</h3>
            <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements. For example, the &lt;img&gt; element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
            <p class="code">&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" /&gt;</p>
