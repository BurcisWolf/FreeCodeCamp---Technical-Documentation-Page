            <h2>What is HTML ?</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title&gt; tag can be written as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>
